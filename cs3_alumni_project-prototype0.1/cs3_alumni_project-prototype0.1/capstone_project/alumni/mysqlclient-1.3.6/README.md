mysqlclient
===========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python.png)](http://travis-ci.org/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python)

This is a fork of [MySQLdb1](https://github.com/farcepest/MySQLdb1).

This project adds Python 3 support and bug fixes.
I hope this fork is merged back to MySQLdb1 like distribute was merged back to setuptools.

Prerequisites for Installing
----------------------------

You may need to install the Python and MySQL development headers and libraries like so:

`sudo apt-get install python-dev libmysqlclient-dev`  # Debian / Ubuntu

`sudo yum install python-devel mysql-devel`  # Red Hat / CentOS
